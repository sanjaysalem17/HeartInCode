    "Is Isabella or Abby in here?"
    "???" "I think I have you now, Isabella. You'll never win."

    "Abby" "I can't help it. Plus, you'll never know if I'm bluffing or not."
    "Isabella" "You are."
    "Abby" "Are you sure?"
    "Isabella" "Yes. I'm all in."
    "Abby" "I'm all in too."
    "Isabella" "Bold move for someone who is bluffing!"
    "Abby" "Since you are so sure, then check this out!"
    "Isabella" "No way."
    "Abby" "Ha! I wasn't bluffing!"
    "Isabella" "No. Way."
    "Abby" "Looks like I win this time."
    "Isabella" "Agh, you actually beat me."
    "Abby" "Yes!"
    "Abby" "Oh, someone's here."
    "Isabella" "So someone finally shows up."
    "Abby" "You're [player_name], right?"
    "Yeah, nice to meet you!"
    "Abby" "Nice to meet you too."
    "Isabella" "At least you're here now. We need help planning for gambling night."
    "Gambling night?"
    "Abby" "It's what we're doing for the festival!"
    "Oh, that's really cool! What were you thinking of having there?"
    "Isabella" "That's what you're here for."
    "Hmm, well, what are your favorite gambling games?"
    "Abby" "Oh! Oh! I love blackjack!"
    "Isabella" "I prefer poker, so I'm able to beat everyone."
    "But didn't you lose that game earlier?"
    "Isabella" "Forget about that game! I usually win."
    "Okay then. Well, we can add those games to start."
    "What about the dealers for those games?"
    "Isabella" "I wanna deal for the blackjack table, since I won't be able to play poker myself."
    "Isabella" "I'll love watching them lose!"
    "Well that settles that. Abby, are you gonna deal for poker then?"
    "Abby" "Yeah, I can do that."
    "Has gambling been a popular thing for festival in the past?"
    "Isabella" "Yeah, it's really popular. We might need more volunteers for managing the games."
    "Abby" "I guess we can try and find some volunteers."
    "Abby" "They could manage a roulette wheel, if we could get our hands on one."
    "Isabella" "Could we even find one?"
    "Abby" "It would be really cool."
    "Abby" "I can try and look into getting one for the festival."
    "Isabella" "I can easily get the cards and chips that people would be using."
    "Isabella" "What are you going to do to help?"
    "What else does the gambling night need?"
    "Abby" "It could probably use some nice decorations for that extra flair."
    "I can probably gather some decorations in time."
    "It could look like a real casino. Well, as much as we could at the festival, anyway."
    "Abby" "I think that's a great idea!"
    "Abby" "This gambling night is going to turn out so well!"
    "Isabella" "You better come through on that idea."
    "Abby" "Thank you for all of your help!"
    "I'll see you guys later."
    "Abby" "See you later!"
    "Isabella" "Bye."
